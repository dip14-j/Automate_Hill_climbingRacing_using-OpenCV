Automate the game hill climb racing using OpnCV.
# Description 
Automate Hill Climb Racing Game Using Python | OpenCv, Mediapipe.

Hand gestures are super cool to use instead of keyboard keys! So, I have used my Hand Gestures to play Hill Climb Racing game with the help of OpenCV library in Python.

I tried to take the most random game that we used to play during our childhood- "Hill Climb Racing Games" to a whole new level. Gesture-controlled gaming has always interested me and this is my silly contribution to that field.
Step 1--> When we Open our palm of Hand the GAS Button of game "Hill climb racing" will work.
step 2--> when we close our palm of hand the Break Button of game  "Hill climb racing" will work.

# Motive to create this 
In my college a task is assigned to me that create a project in field of software and i have gave the idea of open-cv bracuse it is engaging field i think lot of things 
like Draw in air, calculation, face recognisation but that maker's carnival is exhibition type of event so i have and idea and do explore about open cv project suddenly game autmation clicked in my mind and i made this .
